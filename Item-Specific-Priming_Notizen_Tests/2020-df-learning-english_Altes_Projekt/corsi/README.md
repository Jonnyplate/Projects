# corsi

This project contains the implementation of the corsi block-tapping task, used in the list-method directed forgetting experiment. In the df experiment, all files from `ExperimentalFiles` except for the instructions are imported. With the `index.html` file, the CORSI can be run separately from the whole experiment.
